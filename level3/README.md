Trees are tricky if you don't understand them, just make sure you use recursion to solve these problems.

Invest an hour into understanding how recursively traverse a tree. It will be well worth your time.

A tree is just a linked list with two next values.

Here is what a tree looks like in memory:


			A
		   / \
		  /   \
		 /     \
		B       C
       / \     / \
	  D   E   F   G
	 / \
	/   \
   /     \
  H       I
